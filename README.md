The application only works on Xcode Beta running iOS 26 with on device LLMs.

# Journal Application
Journal is a iPhone app that uses Apple's on device LLMs to help users with reflection. The LLM is used to generate reflection prompts, and to convert user entries into a Haiku form. I am using this purely for testing out the Foundation Model Framework capabilities.

Also to test designing animations.

## Features

1. LLM generated reflection prompts to guide and provide inspiration for reflection.
2. Conversion of entry into a poetic form. A haiku is a Japanese poem of seventeen syllables, in three lines of five, seven, and five, traditionally evoking images of the natural world.
3. Sentiment analysis to determine positiveness of each entry from a scale of -1 to 1 (Negative to positive).
